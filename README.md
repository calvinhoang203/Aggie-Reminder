# Aggie-Reminder 

## Inspiration
Creating a website specifically designed to manage and send reminders to volunteers can significantly enhance the organization and efficiency of volunteer-driven events or operations. Such a website can serve multiple purposes, from scheduling to communication, and ensure that volunteers are well-informed and engaged. 

## What it does
A website that is used only by the administrator of Aggie House. It can check and manage the hours of work for volunteers, and also help the staff communicate with volunteers by Sengrid email API. The second part of the project is the automatic reminder that implements the Javascript in App Script extension on Google Sheets that has the email sent to the volunteers automatically when it comes close to the day of the event.

## How we built it
We set up the local server using node js. Then proceed to write the server logic to ensure the website has functionality that can work properly.  Using CSS, Javascript, and HTML to organize the webpage into presentable project.  For the automatic reminder, we implement it by using Javascript in the App Script extension on Google Sheets, setting a timer that the Google server can automatically check if it's 2 days close to the event then it would send the reminder to participants by their registered email.

## Challenges we ran into
Setting up the server is complicated.  APIs are usually restricted or not free. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
As a beginner, we are proud that we managed to finish our product, especially getting the server to work and being able to connect all of our components.

## What we learned
After the project, we learned lessons of time management, collaborating with teammates efficiently, using more technologies, and putting our learning in class to build something helpful for society.

## What's next for Aggie Reminder
Aggie Reminder still needs to be deployed online, and many quality-of-life additions can be added, such as accessing Google Sheets online instead of offline Excel files, easier setup process, and more.
